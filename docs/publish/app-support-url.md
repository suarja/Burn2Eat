## Frequently Asked Questions {#faq}

### General

**Q: What is Burn2Eat?**
A: Burn2Eat is a mobile app that helps you visualize the energy in food by showing you how much exercise it would take to burn off the calories in a given meal. It's designed to be simple, educational, and fun!

**Q: Is the app free?**
A: Yes, the MVP version of Burn2Eat is completely free to use.

### Calculations

**Q: How is the exercise time calculated?**
A: The calculation is based on a standard scientific formula that uses the food's calories, your body weight (from your profile), and the Metabolic Equivalent of Task (MET) value of your chosen physical activity.

**Q: Where does the food and nutrition data come from?**
A: For our initial version, we use a curated, static dataset of 21 popular foods and their nutritional information. We plan to integrate with larger databases like OpenFoodFacts in the future.

**Q: Why do I need to create a profile?**
A: Providing your sex, weight, and height allows for more accurate and personalized effort calculations. Your weight is a key factor in the formula. You can also use the app in "Guest Mode" with average default values.

### Data & Privacy

**Q: Is my profile data private?**
A: Absolutely. All the data you provide (weight, height, etc.) is stored securely and only on your own device using MMKV storage. We do not have a backend server, and your data never leaves your phone.

**Q: Does the app work offline?**
A: Yes! Since all data is stored locally, the app is fully functional without an internet connection.

## How It Works {#how-it-works}

1.  **Set Up Your Profile (Optional):** For the most accurate results, create a profile with your weight, height, and preferred activity. Or, simply start in Guest Mode.
2.  **Find a Food:** On the Home screen, tap on a popular food or use the search bar.
3.  **See the Result:** The app will instantly show you how many minutes of your chosen activity it takes to burn the calories from that food. You'll also see a few alternative exercises.
4.  **Check Your Journal:** Your recent lookups are saved in your History tab, where you can track your daily totals and level up!
